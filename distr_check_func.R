# As the correct mean, StDev, and sampling distribution inputs are required 
# for an accurate MC Simulation, this function is intended to test which 
# sampling distribution would be best for the given security.

# *As always, one can use one of the apply() functions to use this function
#  with a vector.

mc.distr(x){
  distribution <- c()
  # Normal Distribution
